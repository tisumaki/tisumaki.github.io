                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my digital portfolio! My name is Tiia Mäkelä and I'm currently based in Turku, Finland. 
                    I have a Master's Degree in Spanish and I specialized in language teaching and learning. 
                    In other words, I'm a language teacher and one of my main interests was (and still is) how to efficiently integrate technology into the classroom and how to properly utilize the new technologies to make teaching and learning: 1) more fun and diversified and 2) easier and less time-consuming.
                    <br><br>
                    At the moment, I'm studying Full Stack Development with the help of Codecademy and hoping that I could turn my passion for technology into a career: who knows, maybe there's a way to combine my teacher education and my newly acquired coding skills at some point in the future!
                    On this page, I've gathered some of the coding projects I've previously made: including some Codecademy practice projects. This portfolio is slowly but steadily growing and I'm excited to learn and experiment more!</p>
