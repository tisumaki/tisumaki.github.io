                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my digital portfolio! My name is Tiia Mäkelä and I'm currently based in Turku, Finland. 
                    I have a Master's Degree in Spanish and I specialized in language teaching and learning. 
                    In other words, I'm a language teacher and one of my main interests was (and still is) how to integrate technology into the classroom in a efficient way and how to properly utilize the new technologies to make teaching and learning: 1) more fun and diversified and 2) easier and less time-consuming.
                    <br><br>
                    At the moment, I'm studying Full Stack Development with the help of Codecademy and hoping that I could turn my passion for technology into a career and, who knows, maybe there's a way to combine my education as a teacher and my newly acquired coding skills at some point in the future!
                    On this page, I've gathered some of the coding projects I've previously made: including some Codecademy practice projects. This portfolio is slowly but steadily growing and I'm excited to learn and experiment more!</p>
